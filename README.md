webrecorder
===========
A web server which forwards requests and records/replays responses.

It serves as the backend for the [Bookmark Hamster](https://github.com/houmain/hamster) but is intended to be a universal tool for similar use cases.

Usage example
-------------
```
webrecorder --open-browser --inject-js-file test/redirect_all.js --patch-base-tag "github.com/houmain"
```
By executing this command, a local webserver on some unassigned port is started. Which port and the progress in general is reported on the console output and could easily be processed by a frontend.

The `--open-browser` flag makes it automatically open the server's address in the system's default webbrowser.

The webserver forwards all requests to their original domain, serves the responses and records everything to a plain ZIP file. Unless explicitly specified on the commandline, the filename is deduced from the URL. For e.g. `github.com/houmain` it would be `github.comâ•±houmain` (notice the special unicode character for the slash).

By passing `--inject-js-file test/redirect_all.js` a JavaScript file is injected in each HTML response, which redirects all requests to other domains to the local server, so they are recorded too.
The `--patch-base-tag` flag is set, so relative URLs are automatically expanded to absolute URLs and therfore recorded in the correct domain's subdirectory.

The recording can be stopped by pressing `CTRL-C`.

When the same command is called again, the requests are served from the ZIP file and by default also kept up to date (just like the browser cache).
